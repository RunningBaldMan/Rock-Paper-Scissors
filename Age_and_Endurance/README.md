The Correlation between Age and Endurance

# The Correlation between Age and Endurance

This project explores if there is a correlation bewteen age and endurance sports. For the first half of this project we provide a basis using the marathon. It demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization in Python.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python packages:  
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open `Age_and_Endurance.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

## Output
The analysis shows that the average age of fall marathon finishers from 2015-2019 is 39 years old. There are outliers with the youngest age of a marathon finisher being 15, and the oldest age of a marathon finisher being 116.
